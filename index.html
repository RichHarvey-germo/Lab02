          <h2><b>Bio</b></h2>
            <p class="bioMarco">Marco wants to live in a world filled with innovative businesses, affordable flights to Space, and Tech that'll make sci-fi lovers drool over their RGB keyboards. As a Security Professional with more than 7 years of experience, he's worked in various enviornments, from tropical to desert, and from one end of the world to the other. He is a regular contributor of sweat at his local gym. Voted ‚ÄúBest Hair‚Äù by fellow Marines in his company under 3rd Light Armored Reconnaisance Battalion. When he‚Äôs not writing code or sweating over his CodeFellow courses, you can find him at an airport catching flights to all the postponed weddings that were supposed to happen in 2020, or running barefoot into the street to sweat out the copious amounts of caffiene he's ingested. Be on the lookout, though because Marco is wired, plugged-in and dedicated to the cause of being the next best "okayest" software developer.</p>

          <h2><b>Education History</b></h2>
            <p class="eduHist">I've attented a few public education instituitions during my venture through Highschool. Started with Lake Braddock Secondary school, switched to Freedom Highschool, and earned my diploma at Robert E. Lee HS.<br />
              <br />My Marine Corps experience included plenty of education and training with too many schools to name, but here are some: USMC bootcamp, School of Infantry, Marine Corps Security Force Guard, Advanced Urban Combat, Helicopter Rope Suspension Techniques or HRST, and many more.<br />
              <br />After my time in the stumps, I seeked further education at San Diego City College, where I pursued IT certifications.<br />
              <br />American Aviation is my Flight School where I've logged 25 flight hours and can't wait to log more as I work my to earning a Private Pilots License.<br />
              <br />Presently I'm at CodeFellows coding my way into the matrix and sooner than later, coding myself enough experience to start a new career in the software development field.</p>
